## 11/1/2025 - Made the schematic  

I figured out how to make the schematic. I got help from a friend to pick the parts out. I am pretty proud of my design: if its dumb and works, its not dumb!![image_2025-11-01_202301442](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzQ4OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--594b95dd2e649a476e24d44910f6fcc734777555/image_2025-11-01_202301442.png)
