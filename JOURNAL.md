## 11/1/2025 - Made the schematic  

I figured out how to make the schematic. I got help from a friend to pick the parts out. I am pretty proud of my design: if its dumb and works, its not dumb!![image_2025-11-01_202301442](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzQ4OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--594b95dd2e649a476e24d44910f6fcc734777555/image_2025-11-01_202301442.png)
  

## 11/3/2025 - Routed the PCB!!  

LETS GOO! I finally finished routing the PCB! I connected all the stuff with the help of AI and some YouTube tutorials. I hope I did a fair job, don't be too hard on me!![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODEyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--35fe369353d693736815f88fc61a98f06b4b8bd5/image.png)
  

## 11/4/2025 - Side-quest  

I swapped out the DHT22 for the DHT11 chip because I couldn't find any DHT22s in stock on JLC. This won't change the functionality of my project at all.
