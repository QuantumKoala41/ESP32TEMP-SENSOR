Hello! I'm glad I got the design part of this project finally wrapped up! 
My project is an ESP32 (a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-capable module) that is wired to a DHT11 module. This lets my PCB read the air temperature and humidity, then report it wirelessly.
I designed this sensor so I can monitor the temperature of my room while I sleep. This is important to maximize sleep quality!
Instead of getting a ready-made module, I decided to make my own for cheaper and learn LOTS in the process.
